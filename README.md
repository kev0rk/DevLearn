# DevLearn
This is a learning project built as part of my frontend development training.  The design was AI-generated for practice purposes, and the implementation was done manually using HTML and CSS.

Frontend learning update 🚀

I recently completed a small practice project while learning frontend development through freeCodeCamp.

🧠 The UI design was generated with the help of ChatGPT as a visual reference.
💻 I implemented the layout and styling myself using HTML and CSS.

This project helped me practice:
• Turning a design into real code
• CSS layouts and gradients
• Structuring clean HTML
• Building consistency in UI

I’m focusing on learning by building and improving step by step.
More projects coming soon.
